-- NB: the word's on the right are lower case on purpose.
-- read maps text to a superposition (in the future a sequence) of lower case words.
-- so by having lower case, then any case permutation will match.
-- eg, Thx, thx, thX, etc all match thx.
-- I guess the idea is that spoken words have no case, so why should written text?
